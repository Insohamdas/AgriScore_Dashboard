# ✅ CHATBOT FULLY FIXED - Ready to Use!

## 🎉 Final Fix Applied

I've corrected the API implementation to match the `@google/genai` v1.30.0 SDK.

### What Was Wrong:
- The code was using old API methods (`getGenerativeModel()`, `startChat()`)
- The `@google/genai` package uses different methods

### What's Fixed:
✅ Updated to use `ai.models.generateContent()`
✅ Proper conversation history handling
✅ Correct model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
✅ API key verified and working
✅ Server auto-reloaded with fixes
